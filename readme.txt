Adds options to conditionally modify the default query by changing what post types are used, the sorting and more.

== Description ==

Adds options to modify the default query for all main queries or based on when conditions are met eg: if a taxonomy archive is being viewed.

Be careful with this plugin as it could interact oddly with other plugins or themes.

You can:

 * Customise the post types used
 * Exclude terms from any taxonomy
 * Change the ordering
 * Set an offset to skip posts
 * Turn paging off
 * Use a simple meta query
 * Sort by terms in a taxonomy
